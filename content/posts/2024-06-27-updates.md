Alright so to anyone who&#39;s wondering what all the gibberish on this site is all about (all of one person probably lol) I&#39;m kinda poking around, playing with hugo.


&gt; We did this not because it was easy, but because we thought it was easy.

Basically the story of my life.


I kinda decided to jump in feet first when it came to the indieweb and I&#39;m still kinda flailing. Less each day though! If anyone has any words of wisdom when it comes to adapting hugo themes I would appreciate it lol.


Until later!
