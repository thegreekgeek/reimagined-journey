This is my /uses page, where I tell you all about all the stuff I use on a daily basis

### Software

I prefer open source software, but of course that's not going to be the best choice for everything unfortunately.

- obsidian.md
- VSCode

### Hardware

- Logitech G13

    Seriously this thing is awesome.
